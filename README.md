### Hi there, my name is Brian - aka [KellyBP] ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on furthering my understanding of the fundamentals of web development and developing training materials
- âš¡ Fun Thought: If a gunman shots holes in a piece of paper, supposing 2D entities exist on the paper, they will likely believe those holes to be fundamentals that define their reality rather than the whim of a random gunman making the inconsequential decision to shoot a paper. How does that translate to us?
